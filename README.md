## Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dhilan!

I'm a Mechatronics Engineering student at McMaster University. 

I am interested in robotics, and have developed a [Real-Time Self-Driving Software Stack](https://github.com/inhald/svm_self_driving) as well as a [ROS2 State Estimation Node](https://github.com/inhald/state_estimation_node) under the supervision of [Dr. Shahin Sirouspour](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9KcS4cMAAAAJ&hl=en).

Another project I am quite proud of is the [Self-Balancing Robot](https://github.com/inhald/self_balancing_robot) I designed from scratch, which features a multithreaded PID control loop. 

I also have considerable experience in embedded systems, having designed a [2-Player Reaction Game on FPGA](https://github.com/inhald/verilog_ws/tree/main/reaction_game) as well as a number of small projects on an STM32 Microcontroller, including a [Temperature-triggered PWM-FAN](https://github.com/inhald/stm32_embedded_projects/tree/main/PWM-Fan). 

My workflow incorporates a combination of Vim and Tmux on Z-shell. My up-to-date configs can be found [here](https://github.com/inhald/configs).
