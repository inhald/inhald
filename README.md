## Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dhilan!

I'm a Mechatronics Engineering student at McMaster University. 

I am interested in robotics, and have developed a [real-time autonomous navigation software stack](https://github.com/inhald/svm_self_driving) as well as a [pose tracking system](https://github.com/inhald/state_estimation_node) for a remote-controlled scaled vehicle.

I have considerable experience in embedded systems, having designed a [ASIP stepper motor controller](https://github.com/inhald/asip_stepper_motor) as well as a number of small projects on an STM32 microcontroller, including a [temperature-triggered PWM-fan](https://github.com/inhald/stm32_embedded_projects/tree/main/PWM-Fan). 

My portfolio can be found [here](https://inhald.github.io).
