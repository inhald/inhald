## Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dhilan!

I'm a Mechatronics Engineering student at McMaster University. 

I am interested in robotics, and have developed a [Real-Time Self-Driving Software Stack](https://github.com/inhald/svm_self_driving) as well as a [State Estimation Node](https://github.com/inhald/state_estimation_node) for a remote-controlled scaled vehicle.

I have considerable experience in embedded systems, having designed a [ASIP Stepper Motor Controller](https://github.com/inhald/asip_stepper_motor) as well as a number of small projects on an STM32 Microcontroller, including a [Temperature-triggered PWM-Fan](https://github.com/inhald/stm32_embedded_projects/tree/main/PWM-Fan). 

My portfolio can be found [here](https://inhald.github.io).
